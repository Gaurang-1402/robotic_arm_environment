Robot Arm Simulation in ROS2 and Gazebo
  <br>
</h1>

## General Overview

This repository aims: first, to simulate a robotic arm **from scratch** using GAZEBO and **ROS-2**. Second, it creates a custom Reinforcement Learning Environment for testing RL algorithms with a 6DoF Robotic Arm.  Finally, we test the simulation and environment with a reacher target task, using RL and a 6DoF Robotic Arm

In the followings links, you can find a step-by-step instruction section for simulating, controlling, and running this repository with the robotic arm:

* **Simulation in Gazebo and Ros2**
  - how to spawn the robot
  - controler
   
* **Custom RL Environment**
  - how create the rl envoronment 

* **Reacher task with RL**
  - Reacher task
